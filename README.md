# LMS
 Library Management System (LMS) is a simple web-based application built using Flask and Bootstrap. It allows users to add, search, and delete books while keeping track of their shelf locations. The system features a user-friendly interface and supports quick book searches by title or author. It is designed for small libraries or personal use and can be easily extended with a database for advanced functionality.
